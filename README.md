# Electric Vehicle Registration Analysis

## Overview
Welcome to the **Electric Vehicle Registration Analysis** repository! This project focuses on analyzing the geographic distribution of registered electric vehicles (EVs) across various regions, utilizing the **Electric Vehicle Population Data** available at [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data). The analysis aims to uncover ownership trends, popular vehicle makes and models, and potential policy implications related to electric vehicles.

## Objectives
- **Identify Ownership Trends**: Explore and analyze vehicle registration data to understand ownership patterns across cities, counties, and legislative districts.
- **Highlight Popular Vehicles**: Determine which makes and models are most commonly registered, with a specific focus on identifying high-demand vehicles.
- **Assess Policy Implications**: Investigate the prevalence of electric vehicles in the dataset, providing insights into consumer behavior and potential impacts on local policy decisions regarding infrastructure and EV adoption.

## Methodology
- **Data Source**: Utilized the Electric Vehicle Population Data from [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data), which contains comprehensive information on registered electric vehicles, including make, model, model year, and geographic location.
- **Data Analysis Tool**: The analysis was conducted using **PostgreSQL**, leveraging its powerful querying capabilities for efficient data manipulation and extraction.
- **SQL Techniques**: Employed various SQL queries to analyze vehicle registrations by:
  - Geographic distribution across cities, counties, and legislative districts.
  - Vehicle make and model trends to identify the most popular registrations.
  - Model year distribution to evaluate the age of the vehicle fleet in different regions.
- **Data Visualization**: Created visual representations of the data using PostgreSQL to enhance the understanding of trends and patterns in vehicle registrations.

## Key Findings
1. **Top Registered Electric Vehicles**: The analysis identified the **Tesla Model Y** as the most registered electric vehicle, with **44,038 registrations**, highlighting significant consumer demand for this model.
2. **Regional Preferences**: Ownership trends varied across different geographic areas, indicating specific market opportunities for businesses aiming to tailor their services to meet local demands.
3. **Age of Vehicle Fleet**: The model year distribution analysis revealed insights into whether consumers are purchasing new or used vehicles, providing valuable information for automotive companies.
4. **Legislative District Insights**: The examination of vehicle types prevalent in legislative districts offered insights into consumer behavior and potential infrastructure needs for electric vehicles.

## Implications for Businesses
- **Targeted Marketing**: Businesses can utilize the insights from this analysis to focus on high-demand vehicles, optimizing their inventory and marketing strategies accordingly.
- **Niche Services**: Understanding regional preferences allows companies to develop specialized services, such as tailored parts and repairs for popular models.
- **Policy Development**: The analysis provides policymakers with critical information on vehicle ownership trends, particularly regarding EV adoption, facilitating informed decisions on infrastructure investments.

## Conclusion
This project provides essential insights into the geographic distribution of registered electric vehicles, offering actionable recommendations for businesses and policymakers. The use of PostgreSQL for data analysis and visualization ensured a rigorous exploration of the data, reinforcing the credibility of the findings and supporting informed decision-making for future initiatives.
